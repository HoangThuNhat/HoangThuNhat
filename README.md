#  Introduction!
I am a student at Saigon University, currently pursuing a degree in Information Technology. As a first-year student, I have a strong interest in the field of Artificial Intelligence. My career goal is to become a software engineer. At the moment, I am learning C++, HTML, and CSS, and I am planning to self-study Dart to expand my programming skills. This page serves as a record of the courses I will undertake throughout my academic journey at Saigon University.
